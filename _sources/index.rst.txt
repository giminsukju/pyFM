Welcome to pyfmaps's documentation!
===================================

pyFM is a pure python implementation of multiple tools used for Functional Maps computations. Namely, it implements shape signatures, functional map optimization and refinement algorithm, and above all an easy-to-use interface for using functional maps.

The package is now in **v1.0.0** as it has been stable for quite a long time. It had been released on PyPI.
